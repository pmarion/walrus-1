jordan was here

The Walrus and the Carpenter

The sun was shining on the land,
Shining with all his might;
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
and this was odd, because it ws
the middle of the night!

The moon was shining sulkily
because she thought the sun
had got no business to be there
after the day was done
"it's very rude of him, she said
to come and spoil the fun!

The sea was wet as wet could be
the really dry  sands were not fun
the sands were wet and really messy
